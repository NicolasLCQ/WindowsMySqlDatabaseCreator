# WindowsMySqlDatabaseCreator
Launch sqlServer_8.0.32.bat

it will download mysqld8.0.32.bat if you don't have it
if you have it, change the script variable to match the location on your computer.

Create a directory with database information if you don't have it
if you have it, change the script variable to match the location on your computer.
(in this case : No Connection attempt will be realised to modify the root password)

----

If all these steps are already done when launching the script it will directly launch the server on configured port (3001 by default)(can modify in script)
